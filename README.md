# TSP_Ant-Colony-Algorithm
The aim of this project is to create a Python program that, when executed, solves a particular case of the TSP and, at the same time, generates an animation that shows how it works.

The program will use:
1. Pyhton's NumPy to perform certain vectorized operations.
2. Pyhton's Matplotlib library to generate the images.
3. ImageMagick to assemble the images into an animation.
